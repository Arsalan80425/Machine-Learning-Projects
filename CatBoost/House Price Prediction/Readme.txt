🏡 House Price Prediction using Advanced Ensemble Learning
📋 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the sale price of houses using various regression algorithms. By leveraging ensemble learning techniques like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Stacking Regressors, the model achieves high accuracy in predicting housing prices based on features like area size, number of rooms, garage capacity, and year built.

📊 Problem Statement
Accurate house price prediction is crucial for real estate agents, buyers, and sellers to make informed decisions. The goal is to build a robust machine learning model that can predict the sale price of a house given its structural and historical attributes.
