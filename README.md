üè† House Price Prediction using Advanced Ensemble Learning
Description: Developed a robust regression model to accurately predict house sale prices. This project involved extensive feature engineering and a comparative analysis of multiple models, culminating in a high-performance stacking regressor.

Key Skills: Regression, Ensemble Learning (XGBoost, CatBoost, Stacking), Feature Engineering, Data Visualization.

üìû Customer Churn Prediction using Ensemble Machine Learning
Description: Built a classification model to identify customers at risk of churning from a subscription service. This project highlights my ability to work with imbalanced datasets and optimize models for high-impact business metrics like precision and recall.

Key Skills: Classification, Ensemble Methods (Random Forest, Stacking), Handling Imbalanced Data, Model Evaluation.

ü©∫ Disease Prediction Based on Symptoms
Description: Created an interactive web application that predicts potential diseases from user-selected symptoms. This project demonstrates the end-to-end process from model training to deployment with a user-friendly interface.

Key Skills: Multi-class Classification, Model Deployment, Streamlit, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Neural Networks (MLP).
